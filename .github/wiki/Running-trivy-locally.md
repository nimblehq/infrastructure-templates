This project is using Trivy as a vulnerability scanner to replace the role of `tfsec` with some extra benefits:
1. Access to more languages and features in the same tool.
2. Access to more integrations with tools and services through the rich ecosystem around Trivy.

## Trivy Local Scan

```bash
# Project root directory
trivy config .
```
