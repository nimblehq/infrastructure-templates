Follow these steps to copy and include supporting modules from the template:

1. Open the `src/templates` directory in your project.
2. Explore the code and structure of the existing addon or module that you want to reference.

Inside each addon or module folder, you will find the necessary files and directories needed for that specific functionality.

3. Once you have identified the supporting modules or files you want to include in your own project, mirror the folder structure and file naming conventions of the existing addon or module that you are referencing.

4. Copy and paste the relevant files from the existing addon or module into your new addon/module folder.

> **Note**!\
> Make sure to update any necessary configuration or code inside the copied files to fit your specific requirements.

By following this process, you can use the existing templates as a reference to create your own addons or modules based on the provided structure and functionality.
