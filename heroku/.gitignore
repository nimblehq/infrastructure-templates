# IF YOU ARE USING A REMOVE BACKEND LIKE AWS S3 YOUR SHOULD UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINES.
# WHEN USING A REMOTE BACKEND YOU DO NOT NEED TO COMMIT THE .tfstate FILE TO THE GIT REPOSITORY.

# .tfstate files
# *.tfstate
# *.tfstate.*

# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.
#
# example.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf
